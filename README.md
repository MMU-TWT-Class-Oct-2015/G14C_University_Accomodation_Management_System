[Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html ) is a free and open source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. We are using the XAMPP server to host the database of MYSQL. Activating the XAMPP server by selecting the XAMPP Control Panel from the XAMPP Menu. After the XAMPP is activated, an icon       appears in the right hand bottom corner of the desktop. The XAMPP Control Panel interface is shown below when you double click the icon.Press the Start button of Apache and MySQL. MySQL will work smoothly when there is no error found in the bottom message box.

##### Text Editor
The text editors are needed to be able to write the code for our project which is the University Accomodation Management System. You can use any of your preffered text editor but mainly 4 of us used either [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)  or the highly popular [Atom.io](https://atom.io/). We can also use our notepad to write down the programming language.
